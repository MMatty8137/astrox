# Cloud recognition and calculations

In this project we attempted to design a system to figure out the ceiling height of some clouds. We used machine learning for finding the clouds and making a cloudshade fingerprint.

> A cloushade fingerprint is a string of pixels in a set direction from the centre of the bounding box, it goes in the direction where the shadow is expected to be, changes in contrast correspond to cloud-ground-shade boudaries, shadow distance can then be easily calculated.

**Designed by Matyáš Matta, Eduard Plic, Lucie Kohoutková, Tomáš Rajchman and David Němec as a Mission Space Lab project for the European Space Agency.**
**Made possible thanks to the enormous support by the University of West Bohemia, kudos!**
